                    <p>It has been roughly three months since I have started my senior highschool here in Manila at De La Salle University. Entering in a university is tough. They treat you like a college kid as well. Currently, I have beens struggling to finish well in my <i>acads</i>.<br><br> <b>It was a rough start</b>. <br><br>

                        It has been a-long-week since the time I heard a word from you. As much as the rush of paperworks came in, the same dash of my intense eagerness to see you again. Despite this, relentless efforts and hardwork are paid off through celebration with my friends here and high marks attained.

                    </p>

                    <p>Old times roll, my buddy here, Jerahmeel, and I went to this famous spot for froshies in DLSU, Tori Box. As unique (for me) the sound of the name of the place sound. I was kind of not impressed with its store environment.
                    </p>

                    <span class="caption text-muted">Tori Box as seen from the Castro Corner</span>
                    
                    <p>Many of my friends in DLSU have really recommended this place. Yet, I was disappointed by the store's place and the overwhelming number of students queued among the checks. But, I disregarded this and went on to by my food, a pork katsudon. 
                    </p>

                    <span class="caption text-muted">Tori Box: The Inside</span>

                    <p>I lighted first and observed that it is a typical fastfood place, food posters on the walls, common noise and brightly-colored everything else. However, as I have said, the ambiance seemed off since it was quite dingy and a pile of uncleaned plates are heavily observed inside.
                    </p>

                    <p>After few food preparation minutes, orders are complete and we munched on our food. It was okay but I think was a bit overpriced for the quantity and quality they served. I thought I would have made my rough day better but it was still off.</p>

                    <span class="caption text-muted">Tori Katsu's Bit Overpriced Katsudon</span>

                    <p>To make things worse, it rained heavily. It was a hassle but the days progress, and nights become long for me. We packed up and headed back to class. 
                    </p>
                        
                    <blockquote> At the end of the day, I have learned not to try pork katsu or any other katsu at Tori Box again and stick to their famous chix pops instead. It was not totally disappointing but they have okay food contrariwise.
